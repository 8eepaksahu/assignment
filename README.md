Q.2How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
answer:that web application performance is user-friendly and runs smoothly. A well-oiled website and its applications represent the face of a company, and in an ideal scenario, they serve as a mark of reliability, innovation, and progress.
Behind the scenes of a well-run web app is a proactive IT team that uses application performance monitoring tools to catch DevOps issues as they arise, addressing them in real time. By reducing the margin of error of a web application and minimizing maintenance needs, businesses can deliver a better end product to consumers.
Here are seven of the most common web application performance roadblocks and how to fix them
1.DNS issues and network connectivity
2.Slow servers and loading time
3.Poorly written code
4.Lack of load balancing
5.Traffic spikes
6.Specific HTML title tags
7.Failing to optimize bandwidth Usage
1. DNS issues and network connectivity
An essential element of successful web traffic management is DNS queries, which is why an issue with these systems can result in a plethora of issues. Without the proper protection, faulty DNS queries can prevent visitors from reaching your website, while also causing errors, 404s, and incorrect pathways. In a similar vein, network connectivity and an efficient firewall are key parts of your site’s access and productivity.https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:What-is-a-dns-leak1.png
2.
Slow servers and loading time
[slider.zip](https://github.com/8eepaksahu/assignment/files/6385720/slider.zip)

If your servers are particularly slow, they could be hosted using a shared account, which means that your site is sharing the server with hundreds, possibly thousands of other websites. You can address this common roadblock by checking with your hosting company to determine whether or not the site is hosted on a dedicated server. If it isn’t, you can request this service, but it may come at an additional price.
3.Poorly written code
Another web application performance problem that many face is with poorly written code, which could refer to inefficient code, memory leaks, or synchronization issues. Your application could also deadlock due to ineffectual algorithms, as well as the performance degradation of a web application. Old versions of software or integrated legacy systems can also take a toll on your website’s performance.
4.Lack of load balancing
Slow response times can also be caused by poor load distribution. When new site visitors are assigned incorrectly, it can drown out your servers even if the system is under capacity. Such an issue can cause a slow response time, especially if your site is receiving too many requests.

Tools such as NeoLoad and AppPerfect help you find infrastructural weaknesses that you may be experiencing, while also testing problem areas. You should also work on a cluster of servers instead of simply having a single server that takes all the load. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) can help with scalability issues when more servers are added.
5.5) Traffic spikes
Spikes happen, especially during a marketing promotion with videos, and a company may not be prepared for the extra traffic. This issue can also cause your servers to slow down, hindering the performance of your site and harming your brand.
6.6) Specific HTML title tags
Even the name of your website can affect its performance as HTML title tags are essential to its success. These tags sum up the entire content of your website or web page to major search engines such as Google. However, a lack of specificity in your domain name can lower its visibility. This is due to the fact that sometimes site owners use the same title throughout their website, which causes search engines to look for duplicate title tags and pares them, causing sites to lose traffic.
7.Failing to optimize bandwidth usage
When developing and testing a site, businesses often rely on a local network environment. This may not seem like an issue at first because adding visual, audio, video or other high-volume data may not affect your local network. However, consumers accessing the website at home through their smartphones may face a series of issues you weren’t anticipating.

Make sure you optimize your bandwidth usage for a performance boost. Some of the elements you can include are the minification of JavaScript, the minification of all CSS, server side HTTP compression and optimization of image size and resolution.
yes In website problem issue sir i solve always in exam website always delay and traffic so solving problem sir.
Q.3Please describe yourself using JSON.[CRUD.zip](https://github.com/8eepaksahu/assignment/files/6385674/CRUD.zip)

answer:JSON is the abbreviation of JavaScript Object Notation. It is one of the simplest data interchange format, independent of programming language and platform. Its lightweight text-based structure makes it easily readable. It is derived from JavaScript for presenting simple data in the form of key-value pairs.

It is often used for serialization and transmission of data between the network connections. It is mostly used for data transmission between a web application and the server thereby making it a popular alternative to the XML format
2.Douglas Crockford is known as the father of JSON. Douglas Crockford was the person who originally defined the JSON format back in 2000.
3. most of the technologies that work with the data transmission between the systems, support JSON format. Due to its text-based nature, nearly all the programming languages and platforms can support JSON. These include Javascript, C, C++, C#, Perl, Java, Python, Php, etc.
4. An object is defined as a set of key-value pairs. A JSON starts with a left brace “{“ and ends with another right brace “}”. Every key is followed by a colon “:” and the key-value pairs are separated from each other by using a comma “,”. So, basically, the JSON object is a collection of keys along with their values arranged in a pre-specified JSON format.
5. A JSON file has an extension of “.json”. Being in a text-based format, a JSON file can be viewed or edited using any text editor like notepad or notepad++.
6. JSON structure possesses numerous advantages over the other data interchange formats. They are:

Easy to use and fast nature. JSON syntax offers easy parsing of data and even faster implementation. The light-weight structure of JSON allows it to respond at a much faster rate.
Compatible with numerous operating systems and browsers. This allows JSON schema to be attuned to many platforms without any extra effort to make sure its compatibility with another platform.
Supports a wide range of data types including integers, double, String, Boolean, etc.
7.JSON is one of the most popular data interchange format available in today’s scenario. It has several advantages over the other formats but at the same time, it also has its own set of limitations too. They are:

As the data gets complex with several nested or hierarchical structures, it becomes complex for human readability.
JSON is not suitable for handling very complex large data.
JSON doesn’t have support for handling multimedia formats such as rich text or images.
It doesn’t support comments.
8.JSON is mainly used for data interchange between the two systems.

JSON is prominently used for transmission of serialized data over a network connection between two systems.
APIs and web services use JSON to format and transfer data.
JSON can be used in combination with most of the modern programming languages.
JSON can be used with JavaScript applications such as browser plugins and websites.
JSON can be used to read data from the web server and display data on the web pages.
9.There are several rules that describe the structure of the JSON. These are:

Data inside a JSON is arranged in key-value pair. The left side represents the key and the data on the right side represents value. Both key and value are separated by a colon “:”.
Each set of key-value pair is separated from the other pair by using a comma “,”.
Curly braces define the JSON objects. Left curly brace “{“ represents the start of the object and right curly brace “}” represents the end of an object.
Arrays are defined inside a JSON object by using square brackets “[ ]”.
10.Support for JSON is included in almost all the new versions of the browsers. Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, etc. all support JSON format.
11.JSON data is written as name/value pairs, just like JavaScript object properties.

A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value:

"firstName":"John"
12.JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation

JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data

JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page

JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand
13.It is used to parse the data present inside the JSON into objects for using its values.

The syntax used to parse JSON data:

string json = ‘{
"Brand": "Hyundai",
"Name": "Verna",
"Color": “Red”
}’
var obj = JSON.parse(json);
This will convert JSON data into the object from which we can retrieve the data for use with the application.
14.There are several popular libraries available for JSON in .net. Some of them are:

Newtonsoft: It is one of the most widely used frameworks to convert using c#. It is quite famous because of its flexibility and performance. It also supports JSON to XML conversion.
DataContractJsonSerializer: This is the built-in library provided by Microsoft for handling JSON objects within the .net environment.
15.JSON Syntax Rules
Data is in name/value pairs
Data is separated by commas
Curly braces hold objects
Square brackets hold arrays
